# Useful GPT Prompts for Web Developers

## Overview

Welcome to the "Useful GPT Prompts for Web Developers" repository! As a developer, you understand the value of continuous learning and improving your skills. This repository is dedicated to collecting and organizing a variety of useful prompts designed to help web developers enhance their skills through the power of ChatGPT.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of prompts that can be used in ChatGPT to solve specific tasks, automate routine processes, or practice and improve various aspects of web development. Each prompt is designed to be a standalone micro-project that addresses a particular need or challenge commonly faced by web developers.

## Structure

This repository is organized into directories, each containing:

- A specific prompt script tailored for a particular task or learning goal.
- README.md files in both English and Ukrainian, providing detailed instructions on how to use the prompt effectively.
- Supporting files or data needed to execute the prompt correctly.

Each directory is a self-contained module that you can explore, download, and use independently of the others.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the directories: Each directory contains a unique prompt and related documentation. Choose the one that suits your current needs or interests.
2. Download and use the prompt: Follow the instructions provided in the README.md files to set up and use the prompt with ChatGPT.
3. Extend and customize: Feel free to modify the prompts or add your own to fit your specific use case or project requirements.
